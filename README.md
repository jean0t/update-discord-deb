# Discord Update
### automatic updates discord in debian/ubuntu based systems

I created this tool to automate the update of the app because once I set the `SKIP_HOST_UPDATE = true` then I lost a lot of updates.  It is basically an automation to download from the deb version directly. Feel free to use if it helps you.

## Installation
1. download the binary or clone the repository
2. take the binary directly or from the `/dist` and give it permission to execution
```bash
	chmod u+x update_discord
```
3. set it into your `PATH` variable so you can call it directly from your terminal instead of passing the path to the binary directly always (which is boring asf)
